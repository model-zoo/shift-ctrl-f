Search the information available on a webpage using
natural language instead of an exact string match. Uses
[MobileBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02984)
fine-tuned on
[SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)
via [TensorFlowJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) to
search for answers and mark relevant elements on the web page.

**This extension is an experiment.** Deep learning models like BERT are powerful
but may return unpredictable and/or biased results that are tough to interpret.
Please apply best judgement when analyzing search results.

### Why?

Ctrl-F uses exact string-matching to find information within a webpage. String
match is inherently a proxy heuristic for the true content -- in most cases it
works very well, but in some cases it can be a bad proxy.

In our example above we search
[https://stripe.com/docs/testing](https://stripe.com/docs/testing), aiming to
understand the **difference between test mode and live mode**. With string
matching, you might search through some relevant phrases `"live mode"`, `"test
mode"`, and/or `"difference"` and scan through results. With semantic search, you
can directly phrase your question `"What is the difference between live mode
and test mode?"`. We see that the model returns a relevant result, even though
the page does not contain the term "`difference`".

### How It Works

Every time a user executes a search:

1. The content script collects all `<p>`, `<ul>`, and `<ol>` elements on the
   page and extracts text from each.
2. The background script executes the question-answering model on every
   element, using the query as the question and the element's text as the context.
3. If a match is returned by the model, it is highlighted within the page along
   with the confidence score returned by the model.

### Architecture

There are three main components that interact via [Message
Passing](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/messaging) to orchestrate the
extension:

1. Popup (`popup.js`): React application that renders the search bar, controls
   searching and iterating through the results.
2. Content Script (`content.js`): Runs in the context of the current tab,
   responsible for reading from and manipulating the DOM.
3. Background (`background.js`): Background script that loads and executes the
   TensorFlowJS model on question-context pairs.

`src/js/message_types.js` contains the messages used to interact between these
three components.

### Development

Make sure you have these dependencies installed.

1) [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2) [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
3) [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html)

Then run:

```
make develop
```

The unpacked extension will be placed inside of `build/`. See [Google Chrome
Extension developer
documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) to load the
unpacked extension into your Chrome browser in development mode.

### Publishing

```
make build
```

A zipped extension file ready for upload will be placed inside of `dist/`.
